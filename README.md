<h1>Assignment 4 in databases software development</h1>
<h3>Made by Hallur vid Neyst and Murched Kayed</h3>

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>
<p>our discussions on the priveleges on the systems</p>
<ul>
  <li>the user responsible for <b>inventory</b> should be able to read and write because in addition to seeing the items, new items will also come in and should be placed in the database</li>
  <li>the user responsible for <b>bookkeeping</b> should be able to only read with the exception of updating in the status column in the orders table. This is because we think that messing with the actual order does not make sense, only the status where fex. "shipped" could be an option makes sense</li>
  <li>the user responsible for <b>human resources</b> should be able to read from offices, but in employees write and read. This is because we think that the offices aren't data that changes very often (if at all), but employees can change their positions in work at any time (f.ex he/she can be fired, promoted etc...)</li>
  <li>the user responsible for <b>sales</b> should be able to read from orders and orderdetails. The user has acces to help a customer with writing data to the order details table. And lastly, update in the comment column in the orders table if something is worth noting on a customer and the item</li>
  <li>The IT user should have access to all (so that there are no restrictions on fixing a database), much like the default root user</li>
  </ul>

<p>Sql code snippets on how we created the users/permissions:</p>

```sql
CREATE USER 'InventoryUser';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON classicmodels.products TO InventoryUser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON classicmodels.productlines TO InventoryUser;

FLUSH Privileges;



create user BookUser;
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.orders TO BookUser;
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.payments TO BookUser;

GRANT UPDATE (status) ON classicmodels.orders TO BookUser;

FLUSH Privileges;


create user HResourcesUser
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.offices TO HResourcesUser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON classicmodels.employees TO HResourcesUser;

FLUSH Privileges;


create user SalesUser
GRANT SELECT ON classicmodels.orders TO SalesUser;
GRANT UPDATE  (comments) ON classicmodels.orders TO SalesUser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON classicmodels.orderdetails TO SalesUser;
FLUSH Privileges;

CREATE USER 'ITUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'ITUser'@'localhost';
FLUSH Privileges;
```



<h4>Exercise 2</h4>
<p>We inserted two users and a mercedes car as the product, afterwards we checked priveleges on users one by one, and in the end we then checked the log. Code snippet is down below</p>

```sql
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1601,"Kayed","Murched","9300","cph-mk420@cphbusiness.dk","2","1621","developers");
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1701,"vi√∞_Neyst","Hallur","9400","cph-hn131@cphbusiness.dk","2","1621","developers");

INSERT INTO products VALUES ("S72_1234","Mercedes_e220","Classic Cars","1:30","Daimler AG","gray colored car amgcap diesel v6","830","67.31","97.50");INSERT INTO orders VALUES ("104256", "2019-02-22", "2019-02-25", "2019-02-23", "In Process", null, "103");

SHOW GRANTS FOR InventoryUser;
SHOW GRANTS FOR BookUser;
SHOW GRANTS FOR HResourcesUser ;
SHOW GRANTS FOR SalesUser ;
SHOW GRANTS FOR ITUser; /*do one line at a time, else you will only see ITUser privileges*/


select * from mysql.general_log;
```
<p>After completing this, we tested the priveleges by connecting with the BookUser and tried to insert data into the payments table. (this should be an illegal privellege) - and sure enough we got the error: command denied to user.</p>

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>
<p>We opened sql in the docker container and used our "it-user" with the password: '123456' in order to make a dump file. Then we exited the container 
and navigated to the mysql_databasefiles directory and copied the dump file in order to get a copy of it. Code snippets on the linux commands are down below.</p>

```bash
mysqldump -u ITUser -p --opt --all-databases > testDump2.sql


docker cp 143ede981bd1:/testDump2.sql .
```

<p>the dump file can be seen by clicking <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hallur20/Assignment4Databases/master/testDump2.sql">here<a/></p>
